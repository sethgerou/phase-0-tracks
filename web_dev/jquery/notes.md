Learn jquery in 2 hours plan:
1. Search: jquery basics (tutorial)
           jquery 101
           jquery crash course
           jquery cheat sheets
           jquery manual/help
           --bookmark/take notes on what looks useful
2. test knowledge
3. generate new list of topics to search
4. repeat from step 2

Might also try:
--generate list of questions about jquery to search for
--generate next steps/ learning goals

Results - what was most productive?
Cheat sheets and w3 schools were best sources of digestable examples.
messing around trying things out was best way to comprehend them.
most effective was picking a feature and figuring out how it worked - for example animate()

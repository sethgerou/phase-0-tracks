<!-- Reflections on GPS1.2:

HTML5 semantic tags serve 2 main purposes - they provide organizational elements to code
that could be shared by many developers.  They also tell non-browsers how to handle the
page - for example, a reader for the blind might read only the content in main, and
skip the content in footer unless the user specifically asked for it, or a web crawler
would know that the basic link structure of the site should be contained within the
nav tags.  nav, main, and header would seem to be the most often used, though really
all are of equal utility and a well structured page should use all semantic tags
that are relevant and helpful.

The browser displays elements top to bottom regardless of the implication of the semantic
tag - if you put the footer before the header, the footer will display about the header.

I learned how to create a snippet, and where to save new ones.  Atom is my preferred text
editor, so I'll need to learn the equivalent of a snippet for Atom.  I absolutley do see myself creating new snippets all the time.

Nothing in this challenge was particularly difficult.  I need to spend some time
practicing with semantic tags - I try to be a good commenter, and being in the habit of
always using semantic tags would seem to be a similar best practice.

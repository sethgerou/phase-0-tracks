Using an Elevator:

- Approach elevator
- Locate 'up' and/or 'down' button(s). - there may only be 1.
- Press the button for the desired direction.
- Wait for doors to open.
- Enter elevator
- Look for array of buttons with numbers on them
- if no information on desired floor number
  - contact programmer via standard means
  - if programmer is unreachable or has no input
    - press door open button and exit elevator
- otherwise - continue using input from programmer...
- Press button with number corresponding to the desired floor - doors will close if they haven't already.
- Wait
- Elevator will have an illuminated number near the buttons or above the door
  - watch for the number to match desired floor number
  - doors will open when the number matches your desired floor number
    -note: doors may open for numbers matching other users desired floor - Ignore.
  - When the doors open, exit the elevator
- Continue

Turn on Shower:

- enter bathroom
- locate "tub" or "shower stall"
  - will be located behind a glass wall or a curtain
- enter tub/shower stall
- locate water control handle(s) and follow instructions for handle type
  - handle types:
    - 2 separate handles - one "hot", one "cold"
      - rotate both handles counter-clockwise about 1 turn.
      - wait 20 seconds.
      - is water too hot?
        - if yes, rotate left handle (or labeled 'H') clockwise 1/4 turn.
        -re-evaluate
      - is water too cold?
        - if yes, rotate right handle (or labeled 'C') counter-clockwise 1/4 turn.
        - re-evaluate
    - 1 handle - rotates
        - rotate handle clockwise 1/4 turn.
        - wait 20 seconds.
          - is water too hot?
            - if yes, rotate handle counter-clockwise 1/4 turn.
            - re-evaluate
          - is water too cold?
            - if yes, rotate handle clockwise 1/4 turn.
            - re-evaluate
    - 1 handle - lifts up and pivots left or right
        - lift handle straight up.
        - wait 20 seconds.
          - is water too hot?
            - if yes, pivot handle right 10 degrees.
            - re-evaluate
          - is water too cold?
            - if yes, pivot handle left 10 degrees.
            - re-evaluate
----------------
(typical follow up algorithms)
- shower (see showering algorithm)
- turn off shower
  - move handle in opposite direction of on directions - until it doesn't go any further
  - if water has stopped, good job! you're done!
  - if water has not stopped, re-read the directions and try again.
